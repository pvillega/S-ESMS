# S-ESMS

A port of [ESMS](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/programs-and-code/esms/) to Scala

# Changes from original ESMS

No logic changes have been done for this first release. This means that when generating a roaster or simulating a match, the application should behave the same as its C++ counterpart in its v.2.7.3 release.

That said, besides the obvious change of porting the source to Scala, I've done some other minor modifications:

* Purpose: the original ESMS produced a set of executables that could be run to do specific tasks. Instead, this implementation is intended to be used as a Jar that provides ways to do the same tasks and it's used inside of another application.

* Use of JSON: the original API used plain-text files as input/output. The API now uses JSON to communicate with potential clients.

* Countries: the original ESMS has a limited list of 20 countries. This has been extended to a list of all countries, and the official 2 letter country code is used to identify them

* Random values: I use the Gaussian distribution provided by Scala. It is similar to the one used by ESMS and it should give similar ranges of values/ I may modify this in the future.

# Dependencies

The code has the following dependencies:

* [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) for logging
* [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) for unit testing
* [play-json[(https://github.com/mandubian/play-json-alone) to manage conversion between classes and JSON

Check the `Build.scala` file for the versions used.

# Thanks
