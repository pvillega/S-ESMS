# Comments for ESMS
# Due to the nature of Properties files, in which duplicate keys are not allowed, and given that we may want multiple strings for a given situation
# A custom formatting is applied to this file so it can be easily translated and it allows for multiple keys
#
# Keys matching a single value work as normal ( key = value)
# Keys matching multiple values have 2 parts:
#  - First part is the key along the number of options for the given key ( key = n)
#  - Second part is a list of the key plus a number (1 to n) that lists the multiple options for the key (key.1 = a, key.2 = b, etc)
# The helper class that reads this file will load the values accordingly and return a random one to provide some variety in comments
